# Stockholm Trip Plan - January 24-26, 2026

## Date clarification note

There appears to be some confusion in the restaurant booking confirmations. January 24, 2026 is actually a Friday, not Saturday. I've structured this plan assuming:
- Friday Jan 24: Arrival + Chez Jolie dinner

If the dates in your bookings are different, adjust accordingly.
