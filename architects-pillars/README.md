## Project Overview: Architect Pillars Self-Assessment

This is a **self-assessment quiz application** designed for software/solutions architects to discover their professional strengths and growth areas.

### Core Concept
Users take a quiz that evaluates them across **9 architectural pillars**:
1. **Influencing** - Ability to shape decisions and direction
2. **Impact** - Focus on delivering measurable outcomes
3. **Long-Term Scalability** - Planning for sustainable growth
4. **Clarity** - Communication and documentation skills
5. **Decision Making** - How you approach choices
6. **Collaboration** - Working with others
7. **Continuous Learning** - Growth mindset and adaptation
8. **Resilience** - Handling challenges and setbacks
9. **Critical Thinking** - Analysis and evaluation

### What Users Get
- **Pillar Scores**: Numerical scores across all 9 dimensions
- **Radar Chart Visualization**: Visual representation of their profile
- **Archetype Match**: They're matched to one of **7 archetypes** (e.g., "Vision-Led Influencer", "Deep Systems Strategist", "T-Shaped Integrator") based on their pillar score patterns
- **Personalized Insights**: Strengths, risks, and growth opportunities

### Current Work
We've been refining the **scoring system** to ensure each quiz option has realistic trade-offs — selecting one strength should come with a small cost elsewhere, reflecting real-world architectural decision-making.
