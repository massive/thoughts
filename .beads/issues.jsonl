We have an 'Understanding Batch Data Products' page (ID: 4982964415) that explains the batch architecture.

Architecture Overview\n- Core streaming components (Kafka, event schemas, etc.)\n- How streaming differs from batch\n- Integration points with RELEX applications\n\n### 2. Technical Components\n- Kafka topics and structure\n- Event schema definitions\n- Producer/consumer patterns for streaming\n- Authentication and access control\n\n### 3. Data Flow Patterns\n- How events flow from producers to consumers\n- Event formats and conventions\n- Error handling and retry patterns\n\n### 4.
