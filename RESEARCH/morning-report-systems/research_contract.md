# Research Contract - Morning Report Systems

## Research Question

How have others built morning briefing/report systems, particularly those integrated with AI assistants like Claude, and what are the proven patterns, architectures, and data integration approaches?

## Use Case

Building a personal morning report system that:
- Runs automatically each morning
- Briefs on what's important today (calendar, tasks, reminders)
- Provides context on yesterday's activities (emails, meetings, chats, work done)
- Leverages Claude for intelligent synthesis and prioritization

## Scope

### In Scope
- Existing morning briefing/dashboard systems
- AI-powered personal assistant implementations
- Claude-specific integration patterns (API, Desktop, MCP)
- Data source integration techniques (calendar, email, chat, activity logs)
- macOS-native implementations and automation tools
- Activity detection and "what did I do yesterday" approaches
- Output format patterns (notifications, emails, interactive)

### Out of Scope
- Building from scratch without learning from existing work
- Enterprise team briefing systems (focus on personal use)
- Mobile-only implementations
- Real-time monitoring systems (focus on daily batch reports)

## Context

**Technical Environment**: macOS with preference for native tools
**Privacy Requirements**: Standard (cloud services acceptable)
**Critical Data Sources**: Calendar, Email, Tasks/Reminders, Slack/Teams, Claude transcripts/logs, browser history
**Output Format**: Flexible - to be determined based on research findings

## Deliverables

1. Survey of existing morning report/briefing systems
2. Analysis of Claude integration patterns for this use case
3. Data source integration approaches (especially activity detection)
4. Architecture patterns and technical stacks
5. Recommendations for implementation approach
6. Source catalog with quality ratings

## Quality Standards

- **Citation Level**: Standard (all claims cited, critical claims verified with 2+ sources)
- **Source Quality**: Prioritize actual implementations, technical blogs, GitHub projects
- **Audience**: Technical implementer (myself)
- **Time Budget**: 45-60 minutes
- **Agent Budget**: 6-8 parallel research agents

## Success Criteria

Research is successful if it provides:
1. At least 3-5 concrete examples of similar systems
2. Clear understanding of common architecture patterns
3. Specific approaches to "yesterday's activity" detection
4. Actionable recommendations for building with Claude
5. Honest assessment of challenges and limitations
