## Priority: High
*Books that strongly match the taste profile*

### James Clavell - Tai-Pan ⭐ TOP PICK
Hong Kong 1841, founding of the colony. Dirk Struan (the "Tai-Pan") builds his trading empire through opium, cunning, and ruthlessness. Generational rivalry with Tyler Brock, morally gray protagonist, political intrigue, sense of place. Same author as Shōgun which Matias loved. ~700 pages, slow burn. High confidence recommendation.

### Edward Rutherfurd - Sarum / London / New York
Generational sagas spanning centuries in specific places. Each follows families across 1000+ years of history. Very slow burn, sense of place as character. Matches Westö/McMurtry love.

### Colleen McCullough - Masters of Rome series
Ancient Rome across generations - Julius Caesar era. Political intrigue, brotherhood, morally gray figures. GRRM-style complexity but historical.

### Jeff Shaara - Civil War trilogy
(Gods and Generals, The Killer Angels, The Last Full Measure)
American Civil War from multiple perspectives. Brotherhood, sacrifice, historical immersion. Hits war fiction + American history interests.

## Priority: Medium
*Solid recommendations worth considering*

### Gillian Flynn - Dark Places
Psychological thriller with family tragedy and survival elements. Libby Day survived a family massacre as a child, forced to revisit the trauma 25 years later. Dark family secrets, morally complex characters, no clear heroes. More character-driven than Gone Girl, explores poverty and rural desperation in Kansas. Match factors: moral complexity, dark themes, unreliable narration. Risk: lacks generational scope and may feel more plot-driven than character study. Testing if Flynn's style connects beyond the Gone Girl movie. ~350 pages.


## Priority: Low
*Interesting but lower urgency*
