## Books that didn't work

Understanding what fails helps refine recommendations:

**One-star books (avoid these patterns):**
- American Gods (Neil Gaiman) - Alienating atmosphere, episodic structure
- Rogue Lawyer (John Grisham) - Likely felt thin or formulaic
- Last Bus to Woodstock (Inspector Morse #1) - Didn't resonate
- The Winner - Unclear why, but strong rejection

**Two-star books (problematic elements):**
- Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (Le Carré) - Too cold/distant despite spy thriller genre fit
- The Last Wish (Witcher) - Episodic structure (monster-of-week)
- Storm Front (Dresden Files #1) - Urban fantasy didn't work
- Prince of Thorns - Likely too dark or protagonist issues
- Best Served Cold (Joe Abercrombie) - Grimdark didn't connect
- The Slow Regard of Silent Things (Kingkiller) - Too experimental/atmospheric
- The Son - Generational saga that should have worked but didn't (compare to Lonesome Dove success)

**Pattern analysis:**
- Episodic structure is a dealbreaker (Last Wish, Storm Front)
- Alienating atmospheres don't work (American Gods)
- Too cold/distant narration fails (Tinker Tailor)
- Even generational sagas can fail if execution is wrong (The Son vs Lonesome Dove)

## Current to-read list highlights

Recent additions showing evolving interests:

**Crime/Mystery:**
- Dead Simple (Roy Grace #1) - Peter James

**Science Fiction:**
- The Will of the Many (Hierarchy #1)

## Key insights for recommendations

**What works exceptionally well:**
- Generational scope spanning decades (Lonesome Dove)
- Long-running detective series with character development (Bosch, Strike)
- Space opera with political intrigue (Expanse, Scalzi)
- Epic fantasy with extensive world-building (Sanderson)
- Crime fiction with recurring protagonists (Connelly, Dugoni)
- Spy thrillers with depth (Charles Jenkins series)

**What to avoid:**
- Episodic/monster-of-week structure
- Alienating or too-experimental atmospheres
- Overly cold or distant narration
- Urban fantasy with forced humor
- Grimdark for its own sake

**The "Lonesome Dove test":**
When considering generational sagas or sweeping multi-book series, ask:
- Does it develop deep character bonds over time?
- Is there emotional weight and bittersweet resonance?
- Does it earn its length with substance, not padding?
- Will the ending feeling be powerful?

**Sweet spot:**
800+ page novels or long-running series where:
- Characters bond deeply over time
- Moral complexity replaces simple good/evil
- Emotional impact builds slowly (200+ page setup is fine)
- Ending delivers bittersweet emotional resonance
- World or period is immersive

## Reading format shift

Your Goodreads tracking declined 2021-2023 (6-10 books/year) coinciding with:
- Switch to Onyx BOOX Page e-reader
- Potential increase in audiobook consumption (Storytel)
- Less consistent Goodreads logging

The 2024-2025 resurgence (13 books/year) suggests renewed ebook tracking on Onyx, but your total reading volume is likely higher when including audiobooks.
